# Week-2-challenge_Stocks
Use multiples arrays to perform stock analysis with performance efficiency

## Project Overview and purpose 

-Refactoring the previous solution code to loop through all the data one time to collect the same information. 
-Determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

## Resource 
-Data Source: VBA_Challenge.xlsm
-Software: Excel with VBA

## Result

-With the table and graph, we can tell that 2017 is a good year, with most of the stocks have positive yields. However, 2018 met the decline of most of the stocks 
- Two stocks are out of performance: RUN and ENPH. Their yields remained positive for both 2017 and 2018
-The performance of the newer code is more efficient 
## Summary 
Advantages and disadvantages of newer refractor code: It is more efficient regarding the performance time. However, the multiple codes made it more difficult to code. In general, the older script is not as fast as, the newer one, but it is friendly to a VBA beginner considering the code is very easy to read and understand. Since the time difference between the two scripts is not significant, the original codes can also work well in the real world. The refactored code is faster, but we created four arrays and multiple for loop, which increases the risk of infinite loop and program crash.
